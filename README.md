# apnagent for iOS

_apnagent-ios_ is an iOS application that has been developed for use with the [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
module [apnagent](https://github.com/qualiancy/apnagent) to facilitate testing and demonstration. It can
be used to test any APN server-side tool.

## Usage

This assumes that you have created a new application in your iOS provisioning portal.

**1. Clone:** Clone a copy of `apnagent-ios`.

    git clone git@github.com:codeHatcher/apnagent-ios.git

**2. xCode Configure:** Open the project in xCode and specify the `BUNDLE_ID`. Select Project > Build Settings, then
from the bottom right corner click Add Build Setting > Add User-Defined Setting. The key is `BUNDLE_ID` and the value
will be the application's bundle ID as specified in the iOS Provisioning portal. For example: `com.codeHatcher.apnagent`.

**3. Build/Run:** Run the application on your device. APNs notification cannot be sent to the simulator. Your APN token
will be logged to the console. Then use the server-side framework of your choice to send notifications to your device.

## Original
This project is originally from git clone git@github.com:logicalparadox/apnagent-ios.git
but has been updated to work with ios6 as the original project hasn't been updated in some
time. I hope this helps some people.
